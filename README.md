# Welcome!
This is my project for the first milestone on RevoU Fullstack Engineering Bootcamp. This is one of my exercise for Frontend Web Development, a company profile for Photgraphy Agency called Creacy. This is an implementation of [the design](https://dribbble.com/shots/23291447-Creacy-Photography-Agency-Landing-Page) created by 
[Rima Dwi Novika](https://dribbble.com/rimadwin_) from [Plainthing Studio](https://dribbble.com/plainthingstudio).
