# Welcome!
This is my project for the first milestone on RevoU Fullstack Engineering Bootcamp. There's nothing in here yet, so come back again sometime in the future üçª

## Idea
The idea for this project is to make a company profile website, deploy it to Netlify, and use custom domain for it. I'm going to use [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/23291447-Creacy-Photography-Agency-Landing-Page) by Rima Dwi Novika as reference.
